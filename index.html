            <p> My journey is a long one, but whose isn’t. I’ll start by saying, I LOVE drawing! I’m pretty sure I popped out with a pad and pen in my hands.
              I moved from Townsend, MA, to New Britain, CT in 1997 and attended Catholic school from second to fifth. During this time, I traded Pokemon cards
              and drew my own versions of them.
              <br />
              <br />
              While at the catholic school, they began testing me for a learning ‘disability’ (LD) when they noticed I was doing poorly and doodling on all my notebooks.
              My dad had to number the pages to deter me from doing this. Being the creative genius I am, I just ended up ripping the last page out and drawing on that… pshhh.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2001, my family moved to East Longmeadow, MA. I went to public school from sixth to eighth grade. The best way to describe this time frame is like a game on
              Monopoly. At first it was a fun but for one reason or another it ended in chaos. I think for a lot of people, this is a tough time and age period. It’s an arena
              for male bravado. By eighth grade, I was bullied constantly, my art projects were either destroyed or stolen (...hopefully to be put in art museums) and I was let
              out 15 minutes early so I could avoid the group of students who would wait for me on my walk home. During this time, I also had received more state testing. Simply
              put, I did not do well academically in a traditional school setting and so I attended a private school, one that specialized with children who had ADHD, dyslexia,
              or some other from of an LD.
              <br />
              <br />
              Throughout most of high school, I did very little artwork. With everything happening in my life, it wasn’t on the forefront of my mind. Sophmore year was a bit of
              foreshadowing. I attended a trade school part time in the morning. During the schools discovery phase, I was able to dabble around in a few different courses they
              offered. I ended up in the schools computer and technology class. I picked that class, not because of the content of it, but because one of the students was playing
              Warcraft 3 and I wanted to play. That year came and went like most people's paychecks. Considering what I love doing today, I think back and smile because I recall
              another student attempting to create a website, which at the time I had no idea how it was done and nor did I care. I do know now that it had no CSS because I
              remember it looking like crap.
              <br />
              <br />
              Senior year was great! I decided I wanted to go to college for cinematography. After spending most weekends senior year visiting colleges all over New England, I
              ended up at Curry College… for about a week. I transfered to Westfield State, declared my major, and received a bachelor's degree in fine arts.
              <br />
              <br />
              Upon graduating, I ended up on my own trying to teach myself graphic design. Why I didn’t do this as a focus in college is beyond me. Reading many articles from
              designers in the industry, I decided I should also learn about front end development. Deciding I would get the boring stuff out of the way, I started to learn
              HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and quickly fell in love with it. Like art, this put me in a ‘flow’ that I would be in for hours and hours until my stomach would tell
              me to go get food.
              <br />
              <br />
              While working on my portfolio, I also obtained my NASM-CPT and became a personal trainer to supplement income. See, college paid off… It also inspired me for one
              of my projects on here, the FitForm application. This brings me to where I am now.
