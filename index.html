          <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
            in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.
            Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked
            up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage.

              My journey is a long one, but whose isn’t. I’ll start by saying, I LOVE drawing! I’m pretty sure I popped out with a pad and pen in my hands. Growing up, I was constantly drawing. Whether it was random doodles or the trendiest Pokémon, I couldn’t put the pencil down. At one point, my dad tried to deter me from ripping pages out of my notebooks and drawing on them, so he numbered them all. Being the creative genius I am, I just ended up ripping out the last page and drew on that… but pshhh.　
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2001, my family moved to East Longmeadow, MA and I transferred from a Catholic school to a public school. The best way to describe this time frame is like a game on monopoly: at first it was fun but for one reason or another it ended in chaos. I think for a lot of people, this is a tough time and age period. By eighth grade I was bullied constantly and my art projects were either destroyed or stolen (...hopefully to be put in art museums). The bullying became so severe that I was let out 15 minutes early so I could avoid the group of students who would wait for me on my walk home.
              <br />
              <br />
              Throughout most of high school, I did very little artwork. With everything happening in my life, it wasn’t on the forefront of my mind. However, it was during this time that I started to spend more time with computers. During sophomore year, I took a computer and technology class mainly because I saw other students playing Warcraft 3 and I wanted to play too. That year came and went like most people's paychecks. Looking back at this time always make me smile because I recall a student trying to create a website. In the moment I had no idea what they were doing, nor did I really care, but now I love creating and designing websites. I also know he wasn’t using any CSS because his website looked like crap.
              <br />
              College wasn’t exactly a smooth ride either. I was the kid who didn’t know what they wanted to do. After spending most weekends senior year visiting colleges all over New England, I ended up at Curry College… for about a week. I wound up transferring to Westfield State University and commuting from home. After not declaring a major for a while, I went back to my first love: art. In 2014 I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts.
              <br />
              <br />
              Upon graduating, I realized there wasn’t much I could do with just a fine arts degree. I decided I wanted to combine my love for both art and computers, so I tried to teach myself graphic design. Why I didn’t focus on this in college is beyond me. After reading many articles from designers in the industry, I felt learning about front end development would be an added bonus. Deciding I would get the boring stuff out of the way, I started to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I quickly fell in love with it! Like art, it put me in a ‘flow’ that I would be in for hours and hours until my stomach would tell me to go get food.　
              <br />
              <br />
              Deciding to make a career out of front end development and graphic design led me to discover the UI/UX Design track at BLOC. While completing the course, I also obtained my NASM-CPT and became a personal trainer to supplement income (see, college paid off). Being a personal trainer is what inspired one of my case studies: Fit Form. Coming up with the ideas/design for that was an awesome experience. I am no longer the kid being bullied for their art, who doesn’t know what they want to do. UI/UX Design is my passion and I am incredibly excited to start my career!
