          <p>
            I've always been addicted to art. It's been an off and on stuggle to continue to do it with the busy life I have.
            While at the University of Hawai'i, I ended up picking up pottery and absolutely fell in love with it. It is a dream to eventually have a studio
            for it in my house. Most of my art is handed away as presents or gifts.

      <!-- Section 3 / WHO AM I?!-->
      <section id="section-3">
          <h1>Who am I?!</h1>
            <p>
              My journey is a long one, but whose isn’t. I’ll start by saying, I LOVE drawing! I’m pretty sure I popped out with a pad and pen in my hands. Growing up, I was constantly drawing. Whether it was random doodles or the trendiest Pokémon, I couldn’t put the pencil down.
              <br /><br />
              In 2001, my family moved to East Longmeadow, MA and I transferred from a Catholic school to a public school. The best way to describe this time frame is like a game on monopoly: at first it was fun but for one reason or another it ended in chaos. I think for a lot of people, this is a tough time and age period. By eighth grade I was bullied constantly and my art projects were either destroyed or stolen (...hopefully to be put in art museums). The bullying became so severe that I was let out 15 minutes early so I could avoid the group of students who would wait for me on my walk home.
              <!-- <br /><br />
              Throughout most of high school, I did very little artwork. With everything happening in my life, it wasn’t on the forefront of my mind. However, it was during this time that I started to spend more time with computers. During sophomore year, I took a computer and technology class mainly because I saw other students playing Warcraft 3 and I wanted to play too. That year came and went like most people's paychecks. Looking back at this time always make me smile because I recall a student trying to create a website. In the moment I had no idea what they were doing, nor did I really care, but now I love creating and designing websites. I also know a thing or two about CSS now, which that kid clearly did not.
              <br /><br />
              College wasn’t exactly a smooth ride either. I was the kid who didn’t know what they wanted to do. After spending most weekends senior year visiting colleges all over New England, I ended up at Curry College… for about a week. I wound up transferring to Westfield State University and commuting from home. After not declaring a major for a while, I went back to my first love: art. <b>In 2014 I graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts.</b>
              <br /><br />
              Upon graduating, I realized there wasn’t much I could do with just a fine arts degree. I decided I wanted to combine my love for both art and computers, so I tried to teach myself graphic design. Why I didn’t focus on this in college is beyond me. After reading many articles from designers in the industry, I felt learning about front end development would be an added bonus. Deciding I would get the boring stuff out of the way, <b>I started to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I quickly fell in love with it!</b> Like art, this put me in a ‘flow’ that I would be in for hours and hours until my stomach would tell me to go get food.　
              <br /><br />
              Deciding to make a career out of front end development and graphic design led me to discover the <b>UI/UX Design track at BLOC.</b> While completing the course, I also obtained my NASM-CPT and became a personal trainer to supplement income (see, college paid off). Being a personal trainer is what inspired one of my case studies: Fit Form. Coming up with the ideas/design for that was an awesome experience. I am no longer the kid being bullied for their art, who doesn’t know what they want to do. UI/UX Design is my passion and I am incredibly excited to start my career!
