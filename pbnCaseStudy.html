            Being user generated, the site offers field and store directory, product reviews, a market for buying, selling, and
            trading, a place to organize events, and a great place to share information,  pictures and videos.

            <p>
              Being a solo project, I did everything from the user interviews, user stories, creating the persona’s, site mapping and
              flow charts, to iterating and testing of wireframes and mockups, all the way up to the prototype version. Oh, and I also
              did the rebranding of the logo.

              <li>Focus on allowing users to find content faster; increasing user efficiency</li>
              <li>Allow users a better way to save, follow and favorite threads</li>
              <li>Visually and mentally, create a more comprehensive design layout</li>
              <li>Update the sites appearance with a more modern and clean look</li>

          <h2>THE RESEARCH</h2>

          <p>
            Part one of the initial research was to first understand how users interact with the site. Once this was categorized, I wanted to test
            the sites functionalities in these features. Using a scale of one through ten, I invited three people ranging from very experienced, a
            ten, to some experience, to no experience at all and used time as well as verbal feedback as a way of gauging efficiency.
            <br />
            <br />
            After completing user interviews and noting key user stories, I delved into a more detailed analysis of the originals site functionality,
            usability, and efficiency. When you first visit the page, right away you can see how chaotic it looks. If you spend a little extra time on
            the site, you start to unravel quickly how poor the efficiency really is. To demonstrate the inefficiency of the original site, one of the
            objectives during the assessment was to simply find your profile from the main forum page. Using time as measurement of efficiency, all three
            users were unable to find their profile within 40 seconds.

                  Well I already can't find how to get to anyything that'd be "my account"... am I retarded... ohh, I found it. User CP, it's like in the
                  middle of the nav menu. That's dumb. And since when does CP mean control panel. Honestely, this is horrible.

                  Mmmmk, I was able to subscribe to a thread and find it, but I can see how someone with less experience with the internet forums would confused.
                  There's not like enough separation of all the elements in my opinion; everything bleeds together. A generic hyperlink has the same styling as
                  any other link that is on the page which makes it really hard to discern things as being different. Nothing is a button, nothing is really
                  stylized and everything is really light font-weight.

                  It was easy. I don't really remember what the original site was, but it was pretty self-explanatory. It's more apparent with yours because it's not
                  square in the middle of a menu... it's on the end where I would assume most people think. And it's not listed as CP which is dumb.

                  After a user functionality test, added hearts (favorites) next to the thread titles when you are actually inside the thread is definitely easier than
                  PbNation. Everything there is hidden behind a drop down, a menu, or a separate page. I feel like 'subscribe to this thread' is something that people
                  are going to want to do a whole bunch. I think that it deserves its own element. It deserves some screen real estate.

          <p>
            Once data was collected for the features tested, I then moved onto trying to find data on user demographics for the site. Unfortunately,
            there was no real way to extract accurate information due to the nature of not being a mainstream sport. It can be correlated though, through
            other paintball companies, who target males between ages of 12 - 24, that this is roughly where the vast majority of the sites users land.
            <br />
            <br />
            Among bad user feedback on the original site, one of the other large complications that hindered the users experience was the sites search
            system. Between data entries, unless you were a paying memeber, there was a 30 second lockout. In other words, if a user typed in the wrong
            entry or made an error, you were waiting.

            included aspect of buying, selling, and trading as well as a way to organize events, follow and save threads, a more cohesive way to navigate the
            whole site as well as maintain some of the sites older features such as adding buddies.

                        Sharon has been off and on at the gym years. Like a lot of people, having a trainer is expensive and you make sure sure you are getting what you pay for.
                        More importantly you want to know that the trainer knows what they are doing. Sharon has had a past negative experience with a trainer ultimately resulting
                        in a knee injury. With FitForm, it offers Sharon the experience of accuracy, knowledge, feedback and more, which is something Sharon was unable to receive
                        through a trainer. The application also allows her to save up to 90% of what she was paying for a trainer.

            <p>
              Once the initial wireframes were built, I did a second round of testing using the same objectives and people to gauge the disparity between the
              original site and new design. Considering how shockingly difficult it was for user to find their profile, I made it appoint to fix that. With the
              testing, all three users were able to find their profile under 5 seconds. A dramatic increase in efficiency! The second round
              of testing also unraveled other smaller user pain points and other various hindrances that had been missed or not addressed which were then able
              to be corrected. This back and forth iterative process happened until I was left with the final design. Ultimately, I wanted to address every
              common users goal, functionality and pain point thoroughly and that the navigation was both visually and mentally cohesive.

          <h2>PREFERENCE TESTING</h2>

          <p>
            Once the sites functionality and efficiency were addressed, I focused on running preference tests for visual design. Some of the sites bigger visual issues
            were the abundance of hypertext, a subpar cookie-crumb navigation, and the color palette. As a result, there was no clear navigation. Nothing stood out or
            seemed to show any signs of importance or differentiation. It was boring.
            </br />
            </br />
            The goal for this was to maintain a clean and professional look but add a touch color and character. It was important to create clear navigational paths, but also
            represent the world of paintball.

          <p>
            Successfully implementing an improved, more functional, and more efficient site, I believe would make a positive change for users. It brings together
            some of the sites older elements with some newer ones but also allows the user to engage with the content more by reducing wait time, increasing site
             spatial awareness, and as an extra, improving visitor retention time.
