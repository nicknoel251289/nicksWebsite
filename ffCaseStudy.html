          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
            It seems like every year, there is some new fitness trend taking over that is marketed as the “latest and greatest”.  With the rise of
            technology, being sedentary has also become the new norm.  Often times people with limited fitness knowledge are participating in these
            trends and injuring themselves because they have no basic fitness knowledge. Every day, there are more than 10,000 people treated in
            emergency rooms across the country for injuries stemming from exercise, sports, and recreation.
            <br />
            <br />
            FitForm is an application I designed that utilizes both fitness and technology to bring people back to basics.  Users select different
            exercises to perform then the application will use the smart phones camera to scan their bodies and assess their form against correct form.
            Depending on the results, each user will receive suggestions for corrective exercises that will help them achieve proper form.  The
            better the form, the better the results, the less injuries there are.

              As an idea envisioned myself, I was able to play all the roles of the project: client and designer. It was a lot of fun being able to
              fully design and create how everything would be presented.

          </div>

          <p>
            After examining results from user surveys, it’s highly suggestive that a large majority of people doing free weight exercises
            are not entirely sure if they perform using proper motor mechanics. The conclusion for this stems from answers during user interviews
            coupled with emperical data during my time as a trainer. As part of the initial research, a functional screening, to determine exercise
            literacy, was done to demonstrate if users were knowledgeable of proper motor mechanics during common lifts. The high barbell squat, a
            commong exercise inside and outside the gym, was used as the benchmark. The results were relatively shocking with over 50% of participants
            performing the exercise incorrectly. The surveys, as well as my own experiences, were instrumental in determining what features would be
            implemented into the application and website.

          <p>
            The personas created were designed to depict various people with various fitness levels. FitForm will be available for everyone, so it was important that no
            matter what their knowledge is, there would be something for them and it will be easy to use.

            <p>
              Because of the nature of only creating a landing page and because it was a new idea, it was important to know exactly what users would be
              specifically looking for. For this reason the layout was iterated multiple times to try to best deliver and highlight the areas thought to
              be most important. I also wanted to point out the pricing of the application as an additional highlight.

            Preference testing was a big part of this project. Making sure the visual features of the landing page matched well with the app. For this reason
            I created a style guide that could be applied to both.

            The FitForm landing page demonstrates effectively all the important features that a majority of people would use or want to use out of a fitness
            application. In an energetic and professional style, the landing page also showcases how this application can easily be beneficial by being incorporated
            into someone's life from a monetary standpoint and from an overall physical well being standpoint.
